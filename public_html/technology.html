<!--Paragraph about HTML5 & link to wiki about it-->
            <p><a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>stands for hypertext mark up language and it is used used by the World Wide Web.<br />
                The WWW runs on the internet which is an international network of computers which communicate information with each other in a standardised way.<br />
                It does not matter what type of computer you are using to access the information so long as both systems conform to a standard language for transmitting the text and data.<br /> 
                You may be familiar with Hypertext applications running on desktop computers. Unlike a conventional page description language, HTML does not <br />
                define how the text is to appear. Instead, parts of the text are marked as having certain attributes, such as being a title or a heading. The actual <br />
                appearance of these styles is set by the viewing program to give consistency between all documents. You would be surprised at how easy it is to set up a document like this!<br />
                Members of staff who would like to contribute are encouraged to contact us. If you have documents and pictures already in a computer readable form then it may<br />
                be fairly easy to edit them and link them into this system.<br />

<!--Paragraph about CSS with link to wiki about it-->
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is an improvised breakthrough for the progression of the web.<br />
                In the current scenario, most of the browsers are supporting CSS with an exclusive characteristic which allows authority over the presentation during protecting platform<br />
                independence.CSS is perfect to permit the separation of structure. CSS contains all the elements of HTML such as font colors and its styles, background mode, alignments of elements and much more. All these are stored in a class and when you want to use that style then you need to call for that class.<br />
                CSS permits developers to transfer the information to a stylesheet which gives a similar result as that of the HTML code. By using CSS the size of the file becomes smaller and it is easily cached by the search engines. As a result there is a reduction in the network traffic and the page loads very quickly.<br />
